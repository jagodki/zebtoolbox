about=The data of road monitoring and assessment in Germany are stored in a specific XML-schema, which cannot be read by different GI-systems. This plugin enables QGIS to extract the spatial information from the XML-files called Georohdaten and Rasterrohdaten and display them as temporary layers (directly in memory). Just ZEB-files of the type "Rohdaten[...]Geo" can be displayed in QGIS.
